# Rubik-s-Cube-OpenGl
Implement a 3 x 3 x 3 Rubik's Cube using OpenGL. A 3-D view of the cube is displayed on screen. User can choose to rotate the whole cube or one particular slice by using the mouse. A small popup menu is attached to the right mouse button, which allows the user to scramble the cube, to rotate/look around the cube, to reset the cube, or to exit from the program.
